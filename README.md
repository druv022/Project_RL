# Project_RL

This is a group project for the Reinforcemnt learning course offered in M.Sc Artifical Intelligence 
at the University of Amsterdam.

This work was is in collaboration with [Masoumeh Bakhtiariziabari](https://github.com/mbakhtiariz), [Tarun Krishna](https://github.com/KrishnaTarun) and Thomas A. Unger.

## Problem Statement

There are different types of experience replay, e.g.  prioritised experiencereplay  and  hindsight  experience  replay.   Compare  two  or  more  types  ofexperience replay.  Does the ‘winner’ depend on the type of environment?

## Experience Replays
We mainly experimented with three experience replays techniques which are:
```
- Naive Experience Replay 
- Prioritized Experience Replay
- Combined Experience Replay
```
